# Phase Transitions — GSTIC

---

## Transition Rules

### General Principles

1. **Full pipeline always starts at Phase 0A. GSTIC-only always starts at Goals.** Never skip the designated entry point.
2. **Each phase produces a deliverable.** No phase is complete until a structured output exists.
3. **Reference prior phases.** Every new phase must explicitly cite decisions from earlier phases.
4. **Offer iteration.** Always ask if the user wants to refine before moving forward.
5. **Persona shift is explicit.** When changing agents, briefly acknowledge the shift in perspective.

## Phase 0 Transitions (Builder PM Stack)

### Transition: 0A Market Attractiveness → 0B Opportunity Sizing

**Exit Criteria for 0A:**
- [ ] PESTEL assessment completed with directional ratings
- [ ] Five Forces analyzed with structural attractiveness verdict
- [ ] Wardley Map produced with at least 6 components and Build/Buy/Partner decisions
- [ ] Competitive landscape mapped
- [ ] Attractiveness Scorecard completed with weighted score
- [ ] Recommendation issued (Proceed / Caution / Pivot / No-Go)
- [ ] User has confirmed satisfaction

**Handoff Message:**

> "Market attractiveness assessed. [Summary verdict — e.g., 'Moderately attractive with strong tech tailwinds but intense competitive rivalry.'] Key factors: [top 3]. Now let's size the actual opportunity."

**Context to Carry Forward:**
- Market definition and scope
- PESTEL top factors (these constrain sizing assumptions)
- Competitive intensity level (affects SOM capture rates)
- Wardley Map strategic plays (inform where value gets created)

### Transition: 0B Opportunity Sizing → 0C Customer Discovery

**Exit Criteria for 0B:**
- [ ] TAM calculated with methodology stated
- [ ] SAM defined with explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria
- [ ] SOM projected for Y1, Y3, Y5
- [ ] Sensitivity analysis on 3+ assumptions
- [ ] Assumptions logged with confidence ratings
- [ ] User has confirmed satisfaction

**Handoff Message:**

> "Opportunity sized at TAM $[X] / SAM $[X] / SOM Y1 $[X]. Key assumptions: [top 2]. Now let's get specific about who the customer is and what they actually need."

**Context to Carry Forward:**
- Market size boundaries (these constrain segment sizing)
- Unit of value definition
- Geographic and segment scope
- Key assumptions (customer discovery should validate or challenge these)

### Transition: 0C Customer Discovery → 0D Value & Positioning

**Exit Criteria for 0C:**
- [ ] 3-4 segments identified and scored
- [ ] Primary target selected with beachhead rationale
- [ ] JTBD statement completed (situation + motivation + outcome)
- [ ] Four Forces of Progress assessed with net verdict
- [ ] Draft positioning statement written
- [ ] Open validation questions listed
- [ ] User has confirmed satisfaction

**Handoff Message:**

> "Target customer defined: [segment], whose core job is [JTBD summary]. Switching forces are [net assessment]. Now let's define our value proposition and competitive positioning."

**Context to Carry Forward:**
- Target segment profile and priority order
- JTBD statement and job map pain points
- Four Forces net assessment (shapes positioning emphasis)
- Draft positioning statement (to be refined)
- Existing alternatives (the competitive baseline)

### Transition: 0D Value & Positioning → 0E Business Model

**Exit Criteria for 0D:**
- [ ] Value Proposition Canvas completed with fit assessment
- [ ] Strategy Canvas with value curve divergence identified
- [ ] ERRC Grid with at least one Eliminate and one Create
- [ ] Playing to Win cascade with capability gaps
- [ ] Differentiation thesis written
- [ ] Alternatives considered and rejected
- [ ] User has confirmed satisfaction

**Handoff Message:**

> "Positioning defined. We're differentiated through [thesis summary] using [ERRC highlights]. Capability gaps: [key gaps]. Now let's model whether this can be a viable business."

**Context to Carry Forward:**
- Value proposition and fit strength
- Differentiation thesis
- ERRC decisions (shape product/pricing tactics)
- Capability requirements (affect cost structure and build timeline)
- Playing to Win choices (constrain business model options)

### Transition: 0E Business Model → Phase 1 Goals

**Exit Criteria for 0E:**
- [ ] Lean Canvas completed (visual + detailed writeup)
- [ ] AARRR metrics defined with Y1 targets
- [ ] Unit economics calculated (CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC)
- [ ] Opportunity Solution Tree with 3 opportunities and experiments
- [ ] Top 3 riskiest assumptions ranked
- [ ] Market Discovery Brief Summary produced
- [ ] User has confirmed satisfaction

**Handoff Message:**

> "Market discovery is complete. We've assessed attractiveness, sized the opportunity at TAM $[X] / SAM $[X] / SOM Y1 $[X], identified [target segment] with [core JTBD], defined our differentiation through [thesis], and modeled the business at [unit economics]. Top risks are [1, 2, 3]. Now switching to the **Strategist** — let's define what success looks like and set the objectives."

**Context to Carry Forward:**
- Full Market Discovery Brief Summary (this is the foundational context for all GSTIC phases)
- TAM/SAM/SOM numbers
- Target segment and JTBD
- Differentiation thesis
- Unit economics and revenue model
- Riskiest assumptions (Goals should address validating these)

## GSTIC Phase Transitions (Phases 1–5)

### Transition: Goals → Strategy

**Exit Criteria for Goals:**
- [ ] 2-4 primary objectives defined
- [ ] Each objective has at least 1 KPI with a target
- [ ] Non-goals are listed
- [ ] Time horizon is set
- [ ] User has confirmed satisfaction

**Handoff Message:**

> "Goals are locked. We've defined [N] objectives with clear KPIs. Now shifting to Strategy — I'll be thinking about who we're targeting and how we position against alternatives. The Strategist lens stays active."

**Context to Carry Forward:**
- All objectives and KPIs
- Time horizon
- Non-goals (these constrain strategy choices)
- Market Discovery Brief (if Phase 0 was completed)

### Transition: Strategy → Tactics

**Exit Criteria for Strategy:**
- [ ] Target segments defined and prioritized
- [ ] Value proposition articulated per segment
- [ ] Positioning statement drafted
- [ ] Competitive landscape mapped
- [ ] Key assumptions listed
- [ ] User has confirmed satisfaction

**Handoff Message:**

> "Strategy is set. We're targeting [segments] with [value prop]. Now switching to the **Tactician** — let's figure out the specific levers we'll pull to make this real."

**Context to Carry Forward:**
- Target segments and priority order
- Value proposition and positioning
- Competitive alternatives (tactics must differentiate)
- Strategic assumptions (tactics should test these)

### Transition: Tactics → Implementation

**Exit Criteria for Tactics:**
- [ ] Marketing mix defined across all 5 dimensions (Product, Price, Incentives, Communication, Distribution)
- [ ] Each tactic traced to a strategic choice
- [ ] Tactics prioritized (method stated)
- [ ] Quick wins and strategic bets identified
- [ ] User has confirmed satisfaction

**Handoff Message:**

> "Tactics are defined. We have [N] tactics across [dimensions], prioritized by [method]. Now let's build the execution roadmap — same Tactician lens, but shifting to timelines, dependencies, and resources."

**Context to Carry Forward:**
- Prioritized tactics list
- Dependencies between tactics
- Resource constraints mentioned
- Quick wins (these should land in early phases)

### Transition: Implementation → Control

**Exit Criteria for Implementation:**
- [ ] Phased roadmap with dates and owners
- [ ] RACI matrix for major workstreams
- [ ] Dependency map created
- [ ] Risk register with top 5 risks
- [ ] Go/no-go decision points defined
- [ ] User has confirmed satisfaction

**Handoff Message:**

> "The execution plan is built — [N] phases from [start] to [end]. Now switching to the **Analyst**. Let's make sure we know what success looks like in real-time and what triggers a course correction."

**Context to Carry Forward:**
- Phase milestones and dates (these become measurement checkpoints)
- All KPIs from Goals (these must appear in the control framework)
- Risk register items (some need monitoring metrics)
- Decision points (these need data to inform go/no-go)

### Transition: Control → Complete

**Exit Criteria for Control:**
- [ ] North Star Metric defined
- [ ] Input, health, and counter-metrics specified
- [ ] Dashboard design outlined
- [ ] Review cadence set
- [ ] Feedback loops and escalation paths defined
- [ ] Every Goal KPI is accounted for
- [ ] User has confirmed satisfaction

**Completion Message:**

> "GSTIC plan is complete for [project name]. All phases have deliverables. Would you like me to compile everything into a single brief, or would you like to go back and iterate on any phase?"

## Handling Out-of-Sequence Requests

### User Wants to Skip a Phase

> "I can jump to [requested phase], but I want to flag that [prerequisite phases] haven't been completed yet. This means [specific risk]. Want to proceed anyway, or do a quick pass on the prerequisites first?"

### User Wants to Go Back

> "Absolutely. Let me pull up the [requested phase] deliverable. What would you like to change? I'll propagate any updates to downstream phases."

### User Provides New Information Mid-Phase

> "Good input. Let me check if this changes anything in earlier phases... [assessment]. I'll incorporate this into the current phase and flag any upstream impacts."

### User Wants to Skip Phase 0 Entirely

> "We can go straight to GSTIC Goals. I'll work with whatever market context you provide. If we hit gaps in market understanding during Strategy or Tactics, I may suggest we circle back to specific Phase 0 analyses."
