## 4. Wardley Map

*Map the value chain from user need to underlying components. Position each component on the evolution axis.*

### Evolution Axis Reference

| Stage | Characteristics | Examples |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **I — Genesis** | Novel, uncertain, requires exploration. Competitive advantage through experimentation. | Novel ML models, proprietary algorithms, new UX paradigms |
| **II — Custom** | Understood but bespoke. Built per use case. Emerging best practices. | Custom data pipelines, internal platforms, tailored integrations |
| **III — Product (+Rental)** | Standardized, available as products/services. Feature competition. | SaaS tools, commercial APIs, packaged software |
| **IV — Commodity (+Utility)** | Standardized, volume-based, utility pricing. Cost competition. | Cloud compute, authentication, payment processing, CDNs |

### Value Chain Components

*List all components needed to deliver value to the user, then classify each.*

### Strategic Plays from the Map

| Play | Component(s) | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Build proprietary** | [Genesis/Custom components where differentiation lives] | |
| **Leverage commodity** | [Product/Commodity components — don't reinvent] | |
| **Anticipate evolution** | [Components moving stages — get ahead of the shift] | |
| **Create ecosystem** | [Components where platform/network effects are possible] | |
| **Open source / commoditize** | [Components to commoditize to undermine competitor advantage] | |
