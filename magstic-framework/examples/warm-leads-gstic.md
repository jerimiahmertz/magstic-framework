GSTIC Example — Warm Leads Initiative











This example demonstrates a completed GSTIC run for a real enterprise initiative. It shows the level of specificity and traceability expected at each phase.







Phase 1: Goals










Project:
 Warm Leads — Direct Division Lead Generation from Owners Portal



Problem Statement:
 First American's Owners Portal captures rich behavioral signals from homeowners (logins, listing alerts, equity checks) but none of this intent data flows to Direct Division agents who could convert it into new business. Revenue is being left on the table.



Time Horizon:
 FY2026 (Q1 Discovery through Q4 Optimization)



Objectives










Objective 1: Generate qualified leads from behavioral signals





KPI: Number of warm leads generated per month


Baseline: 0 (no current pipeline)


Target: 500 leads/month by Q3 2026


Owner: JR De Los Reyes





Objective 2: Prove lead-to-conversion viability





KPI: Lead-to-close conversion rate


Baseline: N/A (new pipeline)


Target: 2% conversion rate by Q4 2026


Owner: TBD (Direct Division)





Objective 3: Establish identity bridge between systems





KPI: % of OP users matched to FAST file + Agent OID


Baseline: Unknown — requires P0 audit


Target: 60% match rate by Q2 2026


Owner: Dscope/Identity team





Non-Goals











Replacing existing lead sources (referral, marketing)


Cold outbound to non-OP users


Building a full CRM — leads route through FA Mobile







Phase 2: Strategy










Target Segment:
 Homeowners in Owners Portal who exhibit refinance, sale, or equity-extraction intent signals within 6-18 months of their last close.



Value Proposition:
 For Direct Division agents, who need a steady stream of qualified leads, Warm Leads is an intent-based pipeline that surfaces homeowners already in the First American ecosystem showing buying signals, unlike cold lists or aged referrals, which lack behavioral context.



Competitive Advantage:
 Cornered resource — First American owns the OP behavioral data AND the title/agent identity graph. No competitor has both.



Key Assumption:
 Behavioral signals (logins, equity checks, listing alert frequency) are meaningfully correlated with near-term transaction intent. Must validate in P0.

Scoring Formula:
 Intent Score = Lifecycle Score (years since close, 0-5) + Behavioral Score (logins, alerts, equity checks, article views, 0-5). Threshold ≥7 triggers lead.





Phase 4: Implementation (Summary)
















Phase


Timeline


Objective










P0 Discovery


Now (Q1 2026)


Validate identity bridge feasibility, audit signal availability






P1 Prototype


Q1-Q2 2026


Amplitude-based scoring, manual lead routing to pilot agents






P2 Automated


Q2-Q3 2026


Segment integration (TP adopts Q2), automated pipeline






P3 Optimize


Q4 2026+


ML-refined scoring, expanded agent pool, feedback loops












Phase 5: Control (Summary)










North Star:
 Monthly Warm Leads that convert to opened title orders



Input Metrics:
 OP active users with intent score ≥7, lead delivery rate, agent response time



Health Metrics:
 False positive rate (leads with no intent), agent satisfaction with lead quality



Counter-Metrics:
 OP user churn (are we creeping people out?), agent time-on-lead vs. other sources



Review Cadence:
 Weekly (PM + Eng), Monthly (Direct Division leadership), Quarterly (Executive)





This example is illustrative. Actual GSTIC outputs should be fully populated using the templates.
